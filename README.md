DirectX12 Xaml Graphics/Game/App Engine c++ MS VS 2019 16.6.3 by Hot3dx - Jeff Kubitz
It is the DirectX 12 Xaml Graphics/Game Engine
Have fun and there is nothing like being able to add a GUI through Xaml to a program, especially if it is DirectX 12
This template should work in your main Microsoft Templates for Visual Studio 2019 and show up when you want a template for a DirectX 12 UAP, Universal Windows Xaml App, where you can use the designer.
Build is Visual Studio 2019, OS Build 1909, tools 142. x64 Debug Native, nothing else tested

The warp adapter will kick if your hardware does not support straight DirectX 12 This means you can use this for the basis of Intel HD Graphics laptops, tablets, and other fine devices.
Should you want to do anything complicated Chuck Walbourn's DirectX 12 Toolkit That I also have will attach to this with a little work.

Requirements:
Windows 10
Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 16.6.3
DirectX 12
4 GB Ram 8 or More Better!
Intel HG Graphics or DirectX 12 Graphics capable card
NuGet Package WinPixEventRuntime 1.200127001

##Much thanks to Chuck Walbourne and DXTK 12##

Many if not all DXTK12 Examples can be coded for Xaml, if not all of them.

# Errors

In the event of an error,
1) tiny.sdkmesh did not copy to AppX\\Assets\\
for each Debug/Release x86/x64 combination
2) SegoeUI_18.spritefont and segoeui.ttf
did not copy to the AppX folder for
Debug/Release x64.
3) SegoeUI_18.spritefont and segoeui.ttf
did not copy to the Debug/Release folder for
Debug/Release x86.

Manually copy those folders from App1\\Assets to 
these above locations and it is magic!
