DirectX12 Xaml Graphics/Game/App Engine c++ MS VS 2019 16.6.3 by Hot3dx - Jeff Kubitz
It is the DirectX 12 Xaml Graphics/Game Engine
Have fun and there is nothing like being able to add a GUI through Xaml to a program, especially if it is DirectX 12
This template should work in your main Microsoft Templates for Visual Studio 2019 and show up when you want a template for a DirectX 12 UAP, Universal Windows Xaml App, where you can use the designer.
Build is Visual Studio 2019, OS Build 1909, tools 142. x64 Debug Native, nothing else tested

The warp adapter will kick if your hardware does not support straight DirectX 12 This means you can use this for the basis of Intel HD Graphics laptops, tablets, and other fine devices.
Should you want to do anything complicated Chuck Walbourn's DirectX 12 Toolkit That I also have will attach to this with a little work.
